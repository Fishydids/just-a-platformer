# just a platformer custom time speed mod(?)

Me trying to figure out how to mod in a simple feature to a preexisting game (and figuring out how to github along the way).
For context: time speed is something in the original game, however it can't be changed outside of console so as a fun little project I'm trying to make it customisable without that.

(everthing below this point is the same as on the original game's readme since I cbb to change it)
